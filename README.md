# L432KC Serial Communication

This repository contains code for serial USB communication with the Nucleo L432KC board. The communication is handled using a Python script and an Arduino sketch.

## Python Script: `L432KC.py`

The Python script provides a class `L432KC` for managing the serial communication with the Nucleo board.


## Arduino Sketch: `L432KC.ino`

The Arduino sketch handles the commands sent from the Python script.


## Usage

1. Upload the `L432KC.ino` sketch to the Nucleo board.
2. Run the `L432KC.py` script on your computer.
3. Use the provided methods in the `L432KC` python class to communicate with the board.
